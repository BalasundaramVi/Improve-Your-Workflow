## Developing at Hack Reactor

Tackle setup and configuration early

Keep your tools as sharp as possible

Get unstuck quickly

Timebox problems

Stay focused

## Toy problems with VSCode

If you're not using VSCode's integrated debugger, terminal, and version control when you're solving toy problems you're probably not optimizing your limited time.

Stop switching tabs, using Chrome snippets, and letting your tools slow you down.

## Auto-configure your development environment

You might be thinking - "VSCode seems cool and all, but I don't want to configure everything on a pairing station and then have DeepFreeze wipe all my settings/configs overnight. I'll just stick with Sublime \<sigh>"

## ★WRONG★

Automate your development environment setup and configuration with one command.

Check out this script my brother [Alex](https://github.com/avincenthill) wrote for this exact problem!
