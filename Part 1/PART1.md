## Why are you reading this?

- [ ] Do you want to improve the ease, speed, and productivity of your code production process?

- [ ] Do you want to write cleaner and more maintainable code?

- [ ] Do you want to enjoy writing code more?

**If you answered yes to any of the above this guide is for you.**

## Make coding as easy and fun as possible

This is a simple yet ironically overlooked idea developers looking to improve their process need to understand and internalize. If you want to write good code quickly, maintain complex code, or comfortably refactor and improve existing code the development process should be easy, fun (or a least as painless as possible).

Developers that view the mechanical act of programming as difficult/cumbersome/tedious write less code, lower quality code, and are less likely to refactor working solutions to improve quality or maintainability.

**This is guide is about making the process of developing easy (and more fun)**

## Improve your productivity through automation

Automate anything you can as per the time-savings graph below. Extensions like Prettier and others (see Part 2) cost less than a minute to configure and provide hours if not days of time savings.

**Low effort high impact tips**

- [ ] Add aliases to your .gitconfig to expedite routine version control processes

- [ ] Write npm scripts to automate development/build/deployment processes

- [ ] Write shell scripts to automate complex but static command sequences (docker, etc.)

- [ ] Master your operating system and tooling (see Part 2)

## Type fast code faster

There are two types of developers - those who touch type and those who don't.

Prior to starting Hack Reactor I spent 36 hours of deliberate practice to improve my typing speed- the physical bottleneck to programming.

Hanjoon types at 140 wpm - what's your excuse?

## Push quality code everyday

In preparation for Hack Reactor I also decided to commit code to github everyday until I got a job a software engineer. I encourage any developer who wants to improve their skills to adopt this goal as well.

Pushing code daily is not good enough though - I needed a strict criteria for what counts as a quality commit in order to improve as a developer.

Always write good commit messages. Your coworkers and/or future you will thank you for it.
