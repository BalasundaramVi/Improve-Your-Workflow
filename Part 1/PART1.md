## Make coding as easy and fun as possible

This is a simple yet ironically overlooked idea developers looking to improve their process need to understand and internalize. If you want to write good code quickly, maintain complex code, or comfortably refactor and improve existing code the development process should be easy, fun (or a least as painless as possible).

Developers that view the mechanical act of programming as difficult/cumbersome/tedious write less code, lower quality code, and are less likely to refactor working solutions to improve quality or maintainability.

## Improve your productivity through automation

## Type fast code faster

There are two types of developers - those who touch type and those who don't. Prior to starting Hack Reactor I spent 36 hours of deliberate practice to improve my typing speed- the physical bottleneck to programming.
